# newton-dynamics
Newton Dynamics is an integrated solution for real time simulation of physics environments.

Forked from MADEAPPS.
The main purpose of this repo is to generate a Netwon Physics set of libraries for use with the Defold game engine. 
These libraries will be used in the Defold-newton native extension here:
